:books: I hold a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences, which has fueled my curiosity and analytical mindset. 

:computer:  I hold a Diploma in Data Science with a focus on utilizing Python and R for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. The program encompassed a comprehensive study of data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.. 
The [program](https://institutodatascience.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Brochure-diplomatura-en-ciencia-de-datos-con-R-y-Python-1.pdf) encompasses a comprehensive study of data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.  

My journey from biology to data science has been an exciting fusion of science and technology, allowing me to explore complex datasets and derive meaningful insights.

### My Projects:
ðŸ’‰
For my final work to obtain my Diploma in Data Science from the Data Science Institute in Argentina, I embarked on a project titled *"Delayed Correlation: Vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina."* This undertaking involved an in-depth analysis of the delayed correlation between vaccination-related data and the rate of COVID-19 cases in Argentina. Leveraging Python and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and advanced time series analysis tools, I conducted a comprehensive investigation, including time series analysis and the construction of predictive models.
n the project, it was found that the implementation of vaccination programs in Argentina significantly reduced COVID-19 cases. A negative and statistically significant correlation was observed between vaccination coverage and the incidence of COVID-19, with a one-year lag in the data. SARIMAX models were employed to forecast future trends, with the model incorporating an exogenous variable performing slightly better. This project's findings contribute valuable insights into the impact of vaccination programs on COVID-19 incidence in Argentina.
