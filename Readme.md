The [program](https://institutodatascience.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Brochure-diplomatura-en-ciencia-de-datos-con-R-y-Python-1.pdf) encompasses a comprehensive study of data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.  

My journey from biology to data science has been an exciting fusion of science and technology, allowing me to explore complex datasets and derive meaningful insights.

### My Projects:

#### Journey to Immunity: Unveiling Patterns and Predictions in Argentina's COVID-19 Vaccination Data 
##### Delayed Correlation: Vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina
üíâüìâüìù

For my final work to obtain my Diploma in Data Science from the Data Science Institute in Argentina, I embarked on a project titled *"Delayed Correlation: Vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina."* This undertaking involved an in-depth analysis of the delayed correlation between vaccination-related data and the rate of COVID-19 cases in Argentina. Leveraging Python and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and advanced time series analysis tools, I conducted a comprehensive investigation, including time series analysis and the construction of predictive models.

In the project, it was found that the implementation of vaccination programs in Argentina significantly reduced COVID-19 cases. A negative and statistically significant correlation was observed between vaccination coverage and the incidence of COVID-19, with a one-year lag in the data. SARIMAX models were employed to forecast future trends, with the model incorporating an exogenous variable performing slightly better. This project's findings contribute valuable insights into the impact of vaccination programs on COVID-19 incidence in Argentina.

#### Cell Nucleus Insights: K-means Clustering and Medical Classifiers in Breast Carcinoma Diagnosis 
##### Breast Carcinoma Diagnosis using Cell Nucleus Morphological Characteristics
ü§ñüîçüß¨

In my project, "Breast Carcinoma Diagnosis using Cell Nucleus Morphological Characteristics", I undertook a comprehensive analysis in several key stages. I began with an exploratory analysis, which involved uncovering hidden patterns and trends within the dataset to lay the foundation for my subsequent analyses. Following this, I applied K-Means clustering to group patients with similar clinical profiles, potentially revealing insights into distinct patient populations that may require tailored treatment strategies. Lastly, I employed predictive modeling techniques, such as SVM and Random Forest, to develop robust models for predicting malignancy based on nuclear morphometric attributes. My role in this project was individual.

The achievements of this project are noteworthy. For a medical classifier, prioritizing recall and maintaining high precision is crucial to minimize false negatives while minimizing false positives. Comparing the two medical classifier models, the SVM model appears to be better for medical purposes based on the metrics. Notably, nucleus size-related parameters like radius, perimeter, and area played a pivotal role in distinguishing malignant tumors, indicating a gradual alteration in nuclear parameters as the disease progresses. 

In summary, this project has shed light on the progressive changes in nuclear parameters associated with the transition from benign to malignant breast tumors, providing valuable insights for early detection and personalized treatment strategies.

#### From Lab to Industry: Optimizing Bacterial Cultivation through Temperature and pH Insights 
##### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics: Effects of Temperature and pH on Bacterial Growth
üå°Ô∏èüî¨üß¨üß™

In my project, "Descriptive and Inferential Statistics: Effects of Temperature and pH on Bacterial Growth," I conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate the impact of incubation pH and temperature on the growth of a bacterium with biotechnological potential. This research stems from my Bachelor's thesis in Biological Sciences from the National University of the South, although it uses a distinct dataset to avoid any copyright issues. I conducted the project individually and utilized Python for analysis, including bidirectional ANOVA, Levene tests, and distribution analysis.

The key achievements of this project highlight the significant influence of both temperature and pH on the bacterium's growth, impacting essential cellular processes such as enzyme activity and nutrient availability. The analysis of variance indicated a significant impact of temperature and pH on the logCFU/ml of the bacterium, with a substantial interaction between the two factors. Notably, the highest growth was observed at a pH value of 7 and an incubation temperature of 45¬∞C. An interaction plot was used to illustrate the differences observed under varying growth conditions.
